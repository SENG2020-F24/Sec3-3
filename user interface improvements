1. Icon Design: All UI icons should have an attractive and efficient design which conveys the purpose of the icon.
2. Labels: All buttons and icons should have clear and understandable labels.
3. Performance: the UI should perform very well without delays and also look good with graphics.
4. All layouts of the interface should be properly aligned


The performance delay BUG is fixed.
